==Sinopsis
AjaxfulRating generates a rating system with a useful helper to allow you
display and submit rates for a model 'ajaxly'.


==Repository
    git://github.com/edgarjs/ajaxful-rating.git

==Preparing the plugin
You need a rater model (the one who rates a model), commonly a User class.
You need to DON'T have a model called +Rate+ yet, this will be generated.

Use the generator to copy the necesary files to your application:

    ./script/generate ajaxful_rating

Now call this method on the model you want to rate:

    class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_ajaxful_rates
    end

And this one on the model you want to be the rater:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      is_ajaxful_rater
    end

Finally migrate the DB <tt>rake db:migrate</tt>

*Recommended* (but not necesary)
Create a route to submit a rate:

    map.resources :articles, :member => {:rate => :post}


==Usage
Now you are ready, supose we want our user to be able to rate an article only
once:

    # show.html.erb
    <%= ajaxful_rating_for @article, rate_article_path(@article),
    :enable_rate => (logged_in? && !@article.rated_by?(current_user)), :method => :post %>

    # articles_controller.rb
    def rate
      @article = Article.find(params[:id])
      @article.rate(params[:stars], current_user)
      # some page update here ...
    end

As you can see, it will output 5 stars by default. To change this value, write a class method +stars+
in your rateable model.

    class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_ajaxful_rates

      def self.stars
  10
      end
    end

And that's all. You have some helpful class and instance methods as well.
See the documentation for details.

Oh!, and don't forget to include javascripts and stylesheet:

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'ajaxful_rating' %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>

I know it's not all beautiful stars, I'm not a CSS guru so you may want to
customize your output. This style was tested on IE7 and Firefox 2.


====Caching the rating average
If you want to cache the rating average for your model, just add a column called
+rating_average+ as decimal with default => nil:

    class CreateArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def self.up
  create_table :articles do |t|
    # some other columns...
    t.decimal :rating_average, :precision => 3, :scale => 1, :default => nil
  end

  # self.down...
    end

To change the name of the cached column use

    class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_ajaxful_rates

      set_cached_average_column :my_cached_rating
    end


==Notes
The plugin needs to be tested a while, so feedback is really welcome.

Yes, that means it doesn't have tests yet.
