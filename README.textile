h2. Instructions

h3. Install

To install the gem run the next command:

  @gem install ajaxful_rating@
  
You can configure it in your environment.rb file also:

  @config.gem "ajaxful_rating"@

h3. Generate

  @script/generate ajaxful_rating UserModelName@
  
The generator takes one argument: UserModelName, which is the name of your *current*
user model. This is necessary to link both the rate and user models.

Also this generator copies the necesary images, styles, etc.

Example:
_I suppose you have generated already an authenticated model..._

<pre>
script/generate authenticated user sessions
script/generate ajaxful_rating user
</pre>

So this call will create a Rate model and will link it to your User model.

h3. Prepare

To let a model be rateable just add @ajaxful_rateable@. You can pass a hash of options to
customise this call:
* @:stars@ Max number of stars that can be submitted.
* @:allow_update@ Set to true if you want users to be able to update their votes.
* @:cache_column@ Name of the column for storing the cached rating average.
* @:dimensions@ Array of dimensions. Allows to rate the model on various specs,
like for example: a car could be rated for its speed, beauty or price.

<pre>
class Car < ActiveRecord::Base
  ajaxful_rateable :stars => 10, :dimensions => [:speed, :beauty, :price]
end
</pre>

Then you need to add a call @ajaxful_rater@ in the user model to make your @User@ model able to rate objects.

<pre>
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  ajaxful_rater
end
</pre>

Finally, as a mere recomendation to make it even easier, modify your routes to
map a rate action:

  @map.resources :cars, :member => {:rate => :post}@

h3. Use it

To add the star links you need to call the helper method @ratings_for@.
It tries to call @current_user@ method as the rater instance. You can pass @:static@
as the second param to display only the static stars (not clickables).
And also you can pass the dimension you want to show the ratings for.

<pre>
#show.html.erb
<%= ratings_for @article %>

#To display static stars:
<%= ratings_for @article, :static %>

#To display the ratings for a dimension:
<%= ratings_for @article, :dimension => :speed %>
</pre>

Or you can specify a custom user instance by passing it as parameter.

<pre>
<%= ratings_for @article, @user %>
</pre>

By default ratings_for will display the average user rating. If you would like it to
display the rating for the current_user, then set the :show_user_rating parameter to true.
For example:

<pre>
# To display the rating for the current user (current_user):
<%= ratings_for @article, :show_user_rating => true %>

# To display the rating for the user specified by @user:
<%= ratings_for @article, @user, :show_user_rating => true %>
</pre>

There's a condition here, if you didn't add the route @rate@ to your resource 
(as shown above) or you named it different, you'll need to pass the url to the
correct action in your controller:

<pre>
<%= ratings_for @article, :remote_options => {:url => your_rate_path(@article)} %>
</pre>

h3. Important!

*To display the stars properly you need to add a call in the head of your layout, which will generate the
required CSS style for the list. Also don't forget to include the javascripts.*

It's also important to note that this call MUST be within your head tags in your layout, as for now it seems to doesn't work with the @content_for@ tag.

<pre>
  #within the head tags of your layout...
  <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>
  <%= ajaxful_rating_style %>
</pre>
    
When a user submits a rating it will call the action in your controller, for
example (if you added the @rate@ route):

<pre>
  def rate
    @car = Car.find(params[:id])
    @car.rate(params[:stars], current_user, params[:dimension])
    render :update do |page|
      page.replace_html @car.wrapper_dom_id(params), ratings_for(@car, params.merge(:wrap => false))
      page.visual_effect :highlight, @car.wrapper_dom_id(params)
    end
  end
</pre>

There are some more options for this helper, please see the rdoc for details.

h3. Dimensions

From now on you can pass an optional parameter to the @rates@ method for your rateable object to retrieve the
corresponding rates for the dimension you want.

For example, you defined these dimensions:

<pre>
class Car < ActiveRecord::Base
  ajaxful_rateable :dimensions => [:speed, :beauty, :price]
end
</pre>

And hence you can call @car.rates(:price)@ for the price rates or @car.rates(:speed)@ for the speed ratings and so on.

h3. Namespaces

If you use the plugin inside a namespace you’ll need to specify the rating url which should points to
a controller inside a namespace. Your files should be like these:

<pre>
routes.rb:
map.namespace :admin do |admin|
  admin.resources :articles, :member => {:rate => :post}
end

views/admin/articles/show.html.erb
<%= ratings_for @article, :remote_options => {:url => rate_admin_article_path(@article)} %>
</pre>

h3. Cache

To cache the model's rating average add a column named @rating_average@ to your model table:

<pre>
class AddRatingAverageToArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    add_column :articles, :rating_average, :decimal, :default => 0, :precision => 6, :scale => 2
  end

  def self.down
    remove_column :articles, :rating_average
  end
end
</pre>

If you want to customise the name of the cache column just pass it in the options hash:

<pre>
class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  ajaxful_rateable :cache_column => :my_cached_rating
end
</pre>

To use caching with dimensions, make sure you have a cache column defined for each dimension you want cached.
So if you want to cache the @spelling@ dimension, you’ll need to have a column called @rating_average_spelling@ on the articles table.
If you use a custom cache column name, follow the pattern @cache_column_name_dimension_name@ to add cache columns for dimensions.

h2. About backwards compatibility

*Version 2.0 of the plugin works only from Rails 2.2 and on. It uses the module @I18n@ which is new in rails 2.2. Please note that you can use it in past versions as long as you _customise_ the source code.*

I decided to jump directly to version 2.0 because there are many important changes. You can always
checkout the version 1.0 from the repository though.
