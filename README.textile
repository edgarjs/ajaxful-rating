h2. Instructions

h3. Install

To install the plugin:
  script/plugin install git://github.com/edgarjs/ajaxful-rating.git

h3. Generate

  script/generate ajaxful_rating UserModelName
	
The generator takes one argument: UserModelName, which is the name of your *current*
user model. This is necessary to link both the rate and user models.

Also this generator copies the necesary images, styles, etc.

Example:

  #I suppose you have generated already an authenticated model.
  script/generate authenticated user sessions
  
  script/generate ajaxful_rating user

So this call will create a Rate model and will link it to your User model.

h3. Prepare

To let a model be rateable just add @ajaxful_rateable@. You can pass a hash of options to
customise this call:
* @:stars@ Max number of stars that can be submitted.
* @:allow_update@ Set to true if you want users to be able to update their votes.
* @:cache_column@ Name of the column for storing the cached rating average.

  <pre><code>
  class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
    ajaxful_rateable :stars => 10
  end
  </code></pre>

Then you need to add a call @ajaxful_rater@ in the user model. This includes a simple line so
you can add it _by your own_ as well (@has_many :rates@).

  <pre><code>
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    ajaxful_rater
  end
  </code></pre>

Finally, as a mere recomendation to make it even easier, modify your routes to
map a rate action:

  map.resources :articles, :member => {:rate => :post}

h3. Use it

To add the star links you need to call the helper method @ratings_for@.
It tries to call @current_user@ method as the rater instance. You can pass @:static@ as the second param to display only the static stars (not clickables).

  <pre><code>
  # show.html.erb
  <%= ratings_for @article %>
  
  # To display static stars:
  <%= ratings_for @article, :static %>
  </code></pre>

Or you can specify a custom user instance by passing it as parameter.

  <pre><code>
  <%= ratings_for @article, @user %>
  </code></pre>
		
There's a condition here, if you didn't add the route @rate@ to your resource 
(as shown above) or you named it different, you'll need to pass the url to the
correct action in your controller:

  <pre><code>
  <%= ratings_for @article, :remote_options => {:url => your_rate_path(@article)} %>
  </code></pre>

*To display the stars properly you need to add a call in the head of your layout, which will generate the
required CSS style for the list. Also don't forget to include the javascripts.*

  <pre><code>
    # within the head tags of your layout...
    <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>
    <%= ajaxful_rating_style %>
  </code></pre>
		
When a user submits a rating it will call the action in your controller, for
example (if you added the @rate@ route):

  <pre><code>
  def rate
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
    @article.rate(params[:stars], current_user)
    id = "ajaxful-rating-article-#{@article.id}"
    render :update do |page|
      page.replace_html id, ratings_for(@article, :static)
      page.insert_html :bottom, id, "Thanks for rating!"
      page.visual_effect :highlight, id
    end
  end
  </code></pre>

There are some more options for this helper, please see the rdoc for details.

h3. Cache

To cache the model's rating average add a column named @rating_average@ to your model table:

  <pre><code>
  class AddRatingAverageToArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      add_column :articles, :rating_average, :decimal, :default => 0
    end
  
    def self.down
      remove_column :articles, :rating_average
    end
  end
  </code></pre>

If you want to customise the name of the cache column just pass it in the options hash:

  <pre><code>
  class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
    ajaxful_rateable :cache_column => :my_cached_rating
  end
  </code></pre>

h2. About backwards compatibility

*Version 2.0 of the plugin works only from Rails 2.2 and on. It uses the module @I18n@ which is new in rails 2.2. Please note that you can use it in past versions as long as you _customise_ the source code.*

I decided to jump directly to version 2.0 because there are many important changes. You can always
checkout the version 1.0 from the repository though.
